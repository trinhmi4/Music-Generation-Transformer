# Music Generation AI Model
## Introduction
## Data Source
The dataset that was being used was downloaded from https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/. The model use Clean MIDI subset.
## Data Split
60% of the data is training data, 20% is validation, and 20% is testing data. There are 17239 midi files in total, the first 10344 songs is training data, the next 3447 songs is validation data, and the remainings is test data.

## Justification of Results
## Ethical Consideration
Since the model learned from existing data, so if someone use the model to generate music and make
money on it, this can be thought of as using some original artists’ work without rewarding or giving
credit to them. Moreover, AI generated music would also be unfair to the artists since they had to
spent a great amount of hours to create art whereas the model learnt from them and is able to create
art at a much faster rate. Therefore, this seems to invalidate real artists’ effort.
